 **  Default value corresponding to the difference in seconds between 
 **  CFE Mission Epoch and UNIX Epoch. It is left to the end user to 
 **  calculate the correct value.
 ** 
 **  \par Note:
 **  Value could be positive or negative depending if Mission Epoch is before 
 **  or after UNIX Epoch.
 **  NTP Sync will not occur if NTP time is less than this value
 **  This UNIX epoch difference should be against the mission epoch time specified in cfe_mission_cfg.h
