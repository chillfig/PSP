## Building PSP Unit Test for running on Target

All commands can be run from anywhere. Following commands assume that they are run from the cert_testbed/psp/fsw/sp0-vxworks6.9/unit_test repo folder.

1. Build PSP Unit Test application

   > ```$ sh build_psp.sh```

   Above command will build the PSP Unit Test application and save it in the following folder:

   ```cert_testbed/psp/fsw/sp0-vxworks6.9/unit_test/payload/```

2. Run PSP Unit Test application on Target

   > ```$ sh run_psp.sh [TARGET_IP] [KERNEL_FILE_PATH] [TARGET_SERIAL]```

   Above command will connect to _TARGET_IP_, load the PSP Unit Test application,connect via serial port to capture the output, run the unit test, collect the data, convert the collected data to HTML, and finally compress the HTML report folder to a single ZIP file.

   HTML folder: ```cert_testbed/psp/fsw/sp0-vxworks6.9/unit_test/html/```

   ZIP file: ```cert_testbed/psp/fsw/sp0-vxworks6.9/unit_test/psp_ut_html_report.zip```

   > <span style="color:yellow">**WARNING**</span>: If the Unit Test crash, the script will still attempt to collected the data and run all the steps.

## Output Files Description

### runs/*

## Files Description

### build_psp.sh

Shell script to build the PSP unit test. Final application is save in _payload_ subfolder

### run_psp.sh

```$ sh run_psp.sh [TARGET_IP] [KERNEL_FILE_PATH] [TARGET_SERIAL]```

### vx_code_coverage.prj

Project file specifying the Code Coverage options

> <span style="color:teal">**NOTE 1**</span>: Verbosity tag [0-5]
