** \brief CFE_ES_WriteToSysLog stub function
**
** \par Description
**        This function is used to mimic the response of the cFE ES function
**        CFE_ES_WriteToSysLog.  It always returns CFE_SUCCESS when called.
**        The log message is compared to known CFE function responses and if
**        a match is found the value WriteSysLogRtn.value is set to a
**        specified constant value.  WriteSysLogRtn.count is incremented to
**        keep track of the number of messages logged.  The unit test code
**        compares the WriteSysLogRtn value and count variables against
**        expected totals to ensure the proper response of other functions
**        being tested.
**
** \par Assumptions, External Events, and Notes:
**        None
**
** \return
**        Returns CFE_SUCCESS.
